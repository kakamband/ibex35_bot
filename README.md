A twitter bot that posts financial news articles about [Spain's stock market index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBEX_35). You can also ask the bot for the current price of a stock by mentioning it and adding a dollar sign followed by the [stock's ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol).
